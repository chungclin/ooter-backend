# OOTER-BACKEND

This is the backend code behind the Ooter App.  The only two routes are implemented currently with opportunity for more.  Each route posts to one database and then queries the other whole database based on the created instance and returns the result to the frontend to be rendered.

* Created with FullStack Academy's boilermaker code and edited to fit the needs of this app.
